Marvel Rivals - Auto Close Process for PC Players:

1. Save the files in this folder to a location on your local computer. "C:\Temp\MarvelRivalsMod" for instance.

2. Configure your Marvel Rivals desktop shortcut to launch the batch file: "MarvelRivals-AutoCloseProcess-FirstRun.bat". This batch file will run the PowerShell script and then launch your game.

3. Play the game and enjoy. The next time you close it, the process will automatically be force closed.


Please note: This is a temporarily solution until NetEase Games addresses and fixes this issue.
